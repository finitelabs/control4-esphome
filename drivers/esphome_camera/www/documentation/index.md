This driver provides specialized support for ESPHome devices with camera
entities, allowing them to be viewed through the Control4 camera proxy via MJPEG
streaming.

# <span style="color:#17BCF2">System Requirements</span>

- Control4 OS 3.3+
- ESPHome driver configured and connected to an ESPHome device with a camera
  entity
- ESPHome device must have
  [`esp32_camera_web_server`](https://esphome.io/components/esp32_camera_web_server.html)
  enabled in its configuration to provide the MJPEG stream endpoint

# <span style="color:#17BCF2">Features</span>

- Control4 Camera Proxy integration for native Control4 camera viewing
- MJPEG stream URL configuration (auto-populated or manual)
- Real-time availability tracking via the main ESPHome driver

# <span style="color:#17BCF2">Installer Setup</span>

Refer to the main ESPHome driver documentation for setup instructions. Once the
main driver is configured and connected to your ESPHome device, bind the ESPHome
Camera driver to the camera entity exposed by the main driver.

The ESPHome device must have `esp32_camera_web_server` enabled. Add the
following to your ESPHome YAML configuration:

```yaml
esp32_camera_web_server:
  - port: 8080
    mode: stream
```

This exposes an MJPEG stream at `http://<device_ip>:8080/` that the Control4
camera proxy can consume directly.

## Driver Properties

<!-- #ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL -->

### Cloud Settings

#### Cloud Status (read-only)

Displays the DriverCentral cloud license status.

#### Automatic Updates \[ Off | **_On_** \]

Enables or disables automatic driver updates via DriverCentral.

<!-- #endif -->

### Driver Settings

#### Driver Status (read-only)

Displays the current status of the driver.

#### Driver Version (read-only)

Displays the current version of the driver.

#### Log Level \[ 0 - Fatal | 1 - Error | 2 - Warning | **_3 - Info_** | 4 - Debug | 5 - Trace | 6 - Ultra \]

Sets the logging level. Default is `3 - Info`.

#### Log Mode \[ **_Off_** | Print | Log | Print and Log \]

Sets the logging mode. Default is `Off`.

### Camera Settings

#### Camera URL

The MJPEG stream URL for the ESP32 camera. If left blank, defaults to
`http://<device_ip>:8080/` using the device address discovered by the main
ESPHome driver.

Set this manually if the device uses a non-standard port or a different URL path
for its MJPEG stream.

## Connections

### Camera (provider)

The Control4 Camera proxy connection. This is automatically managed by the
driver and provides camera viewing functionality to Control4.

### ESPHome Camera (consumer)

Bind this connection to the camera entity exposed by the main ESPHome driver.
